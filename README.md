# What2Eat

Sample app for demonstrating architecture design in SWAR lecture (HTWG WIN)

There are two versions of the app in different branches:

- branch [initial](https://github.com/neshanjo/what2eat/tree/initial) with the first version (no caching, dependencies
  hard-wired)
- branch [with-di](https://github.com/neshanjo/what2eat/tree/with-di) with a version that uses dependency injection for
  better testability.
- branch [with-cache](https://github.com/neshanjo/what2eat/tree/with-cache) with a further advanced version that caches
  weather and menu requests for a better performance.

For more information, see the README file in the branches.
