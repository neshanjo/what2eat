# What2Eat

Sample app for demonstrating architecture design in SWAR lecture (HTWG WIN)

There are two versions of the app in different branches:
- branch [initial](https://github.com/neshanjo/what2eat/tree/initial) with the first version (no caching)
- branch [with-cache](https://github.com/neshanjo/what2eat/tree/with-cache) with a more advanced version that caches weather and menu requests.

For more information, see the README file in the branches.
